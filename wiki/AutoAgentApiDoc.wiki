=API for auto-agent=
<br>by Stuart Sierra

Usage: 
{{{
(ns <your-namespace>
  (:use clojure.contrib.auto-agent))
}}}
==Overview==
<pre> This is superficially similar to Ken Tilton's "Cells" library for 
Common Lisp.  But Cells is single-threaded and synchronous.  This 
version is built on Clojure agents, so it is multi-threaded and 
asynchronous. 
 
 An auto-agent is an agent whose value is the result of an 
expression.  That expression can include other mutable Clojure 
types -- agents, atoms, and refs -- dereferenced with "deref" or 
"@".  Whenever one of those derefernced things changes, the 
auto-agent will be automatically updated to reflect the new value.</pre>

Usage: *(_auto-agent_ expr)*
</pre>
<pre> Creates an agent whose value is the result of evaluating expr. 
Whenever one of the agents/atoms/refs dererenced within expr 
changes, expr is reevaluated and this agent's state is set to its 
new value.</pre>
