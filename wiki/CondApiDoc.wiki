===(_cond-let_ bindings & clauses)===
====Macro====
Takes a binding-form and a set of test/expr pairs. Evaluates each test
one at a time. If a test returns logical true, cond-let evaluates and
returns expr with binding-form bound to the value of test and doesn't
evaluate any of the other tests or exprs. To provide a default value
either provide a literal that evaluates to logical true and is
binding-compatible with binding-form, or use :else as the test and don't
refer to any parts of binding-form in the expr. (cond-let binding-form)
returns nil.
