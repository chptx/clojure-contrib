=API for condition=
by Stephen C. Gilardi

Usage: 
{{{
(ns <your-namespace>
  (:require clojure.contrib.condition))
}}}
==Overview==
<pre> Flexible raising and handling of conditions. A condition is a map 
containing: 
 
  - keys and values specified as arguments to raise, and 
  - a stack trace at key :stack-trace. 
 
Note: requires AOT compilation. 
 
Based on an idea from Chouser: 
http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse`_`frm/thread/da1285c538f22bb5</pre>

----
===handler-case===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_handler-case_ dispatch-fn & body)*
</pre>
<pre> Executes body in a context in which raised conditions can be handled. 
 
dispatch-fn accepts a raised condition (a map) and returns a selector 
value used to choose a handler. 
 
Handlers are forms within body: 
 
  (handle key 
    ...) 
 
If a condition is raised, handler-case executes the body of the first 
handler whose key satisfies (isa? selector key). If no handlers match, 
the condition is re-raised. 
 
While a handler is running, `*`condition`*` is bound to the condition being 
handled and `*`selector`*` is bound to to the value returned by dispatch-fn 
that matched the handler's key.</pre>
