==Public Variables and Functions==

[#(_file_&_args) file] [#(_pwd_) pwd] [#(_read-lines_f) read-lines] [#reader reader] [#(_slurp*_f) slurp*] [#(_spit_f_content) spit] [#(_with-in-reader_f_&_body) with-in-reader] [#(_with-out-writer_f_&_body) with-out-writer] [#(_write-lines_f_lines) write-lines] [#writer writer] 

----
===(_file_ & args)===
Concatenates args as strings returns a java.io.File.  Replaces all
/ and \ with File/separatorChar.  Replaces ~ at the start of the
path with the user.home system property.
----
===(_pwd_)===
Returns current working directory as a String.  (Like UNIX 'pwd'.)
Note: In Java, you cannot change the current working directory.
----
===(_read-lines_ f)===
Like clojure.core/line-seq but opens f with reader.  Automatically
closes the reader AFTER YOU CONSUME THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE.
----
===_reader_===
Attempts to coerce its argument into an open
java.io.BufferedReader.  Argument may be an instance of Reader,
BufferedReader, InputStream, File, URI, URL, or String.

If argument is a String, it tries to resolve it first as a URI, then
as a local file name.  URIs with a 'file' protocol are converted to
local file names.  Uses `*`default-encoding`*` as the text encoding.

Should be used inside with-open to ensure the Reader is properly
closed.
----
===(_slurp`*`_ f)===
Like clojure.core/slurp but opens f with reader.
----
===(_spit_ f content)===
Opposite of slurp.  Opens f with writer, writes content, then
closes f.
----
===(_with-in-reader_ f & body)===
====Macro====
Opens a PushbackReader on f, binds it to `*`in`*`, and evaluates body.
----
===(_with-out-writer_ f & body)===
====Macro====
Opens a writer on f, binds it to `*`out`*`, and evalutes body.
----
===(_write-lines_ f lines)===
Writes lines (a seq) to f, separated by newlines.  f is opened with
writer.
----
===_writer_===
Attempts to coerce its argument into an open java.io.PrintWriter
wrapped around a java.io.BufferedWriter.  Argument may be an
instance of Writer, PrintWriter, BufferedWriter, OutputStream, File,
URI, URL, or String.

If argument is a String, it tries to resolve it first as a URI, then
as a local file name.  URIs with a 'file' protocol are converted to
local file names.

Should be used inside with-open to ensure the Writer is properly
closed.
