----
===file-str===
====function====
<pre>
Usage: *(_file-str_ & args)*
</pre>
<pre> Concatenates args as strings and returns a java.io.File.  Replaces 
all / and \ with File/separatorChar.  Replaces ~ at the start of 
the path with the user.home system property.</pre>

----
===pwd===
====function====
<pre>
Usage: *(_pwd_)*
</pre>
<pre> Returns current working directory as a String.  (Like UNIX 'pwd'.) 
Note: In Java, you cannot change the current working directory.</pre>

----
===read-lines===
====function====
<pre>
Usage: *(_read-lines_ f)*
</pre>
<pre> Like clojure.core/line-seq but opens f with reader.  Automatically 
closes the reader AFTER YOU CONSUME THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#172 Source] [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=read-lines+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fclojure-contrib\.googlecode\.com&sbtn=Search Search for references in contrib]
----
===reader===
====multimethod====
_No usage documentation available_
<pre> Attempts to coerce its argument into an open 
java.io.BufferedReader.  Argument may be an instance of Reader, 
BufferedReader, InputStream, File, URI, URL, or String. 
 
If argument is a String, it tries to resolve it first as a URI, then 
as a local file name.  URIs with a 'file' protocol are converted to 
local file names.  Uses `*`default-encoding`*` as the text encoding. 
 
Should be used inside with-open to ensure the Reader is properly 
closed.</pre>

----
===slurp`*`===
====function====
<pre>
Usage: *(_slurp`*`_ f)*
</pre>
<pre> Like clojure.core/slurp but opens f with reader.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#183 Source] [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=slurp*+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fclojure-contrib\.googlecode\.com&sbtn=Search Search for references in contrib]
----
===spit===
====function====
<pre>
Usage: *(_spit_ f content)*
</pre>
<pre> Opposite of slurp.  Opens f with writer, writes content, then 
closes f.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#194 Source] [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=spit+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fclojure-contrib\.googlecode\.com&sbtn=Search Search for references in contrib]
----
===with-in-reader===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_with-in-reader_ f & body)*
</pre>
<pre> Opens a PushbackReader on f, binds it to `*`in`*`, and evaluates body.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#216 Source] [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=with-in-reader+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fclojure-contrib\.googlecode\.com&sbtn=Search Search for references in contrib]
----
===with-out-writer===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_with-out-writer_ f & body)*
</pre>
<pre> Opens a writer on f, binds it to `*`out`*`, and evalutes body.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#209 Source] [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=with-out-writer+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fclojure-contrib\.googlecode\.com&sbtn=Search Search for references in contrib]
----
===write-lines===
====function====
<pre>
Usage: *(_write-lines_ f lines)*
</pre>
<pre> Writes lines (a seq) to f, separated by newlines.  f is opened with 
writer, and automatically closed at the end of the sequence.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#161 Source] [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=write-lines+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fclojure-contrib\.googlecode\.com&sbtn=Search Search for references in contrib]
----
===writer===
====multimethod====
_No usage documentation available_
<pre> Attempts to coerce its argument into an open java.io.PrintWriter 
wrapped around a java.io.BufferedWriter.  Argument may be an 
instance of Writer, PrintWriter, BufferedWriter, OutputStream, File, 
URI, URL, or String. 
 
If argument is a String, it tries to resolve it first as a URI, then 
as a local file name.  URIs with a 'file' protocol are converted to 
local file names. 
 
Should be used inside with-open to ensure the Writer is properly 
closed.</pre>
