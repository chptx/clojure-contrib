----
===(_file_ & args)===
<pre> Concatenates args as strings returns a java.io.File.  Replaces all
/ and \ with File/separatorChar.  Replaces ~ at the start of the
path with the user.home system property.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#53 Source]
----
===(_pwd_)===
<pre> Returns current working directory as a String.  (Like UNIX 'pwd'.)
Note: In Java, you cannot change the current working directory.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#198 Source]
----
===(_read-lines_ f)===
<pre> Like clojure.core/line-seq but opens f with reader.  Automatically
closes the reader AFTER YOU CONSUME THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#169 Source]
----
===_reader_===
<pre> Attempts to coerce its argument into an open
java.io.BufferedReader.  Argument may be an instance of Reader,
BufferedReader, InputStream, File, URI, URL, or String.

 If argument is a String, it tries to resolve it first as a URI, then
as a local file name.  URIs with a 'file' protocol are converted to
local file names.  Uses `*`default-encoding`*` as the text encoding.

 Should be used inside with-open to ensure the Reader is properly
closed.</pre>

----
===(_slurp`*`_ f)===
<pre> Like clojure.core/slurp but opens f with reader.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#180 Source]
----
===(_spit_ f content)===
<pre> Opposite of slurp.  Opens f with writer, writes content, then
closes f.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#191 Source]
----
===(_with-in-reader_ f & body)===
====Macro====
<pre> Opens a PushbackReader on f, binds it to `*`in`*`, and evaluates body.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#213 Source]
----
===(_with-out-writer_ f & body)===
====Macro====
<pre> Opens a writer on f, binds it to `*`out`*`, and evalutes body.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#206 Source]
----
===(_write-lines_ f lines)===
<pre> Writes lines (a seq) to f, separated by newlines.  f is opened with
writer.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/duck_streams.clj#158 Source]
----
===_writer_===
<pre> Attempts to coerce its argument into an open java.io.PrintWriter
wrapped around a java.io.BufferedWriter.  Argument may be an
instance of Writer, PrintWriter, BufferedWriter, OutputStream, File,
URI, URL, or String.

 If argument is a String, it tries to resolve it first as a URI, then
as a local file name.  URIs with a 'file' protocol are converted to
local file names.

 Should be used inside with-open to ensure the Writer is properly
closed.</pre>
