==Public Variables and Functions==
Shortcuts:
bind-continue deferror [#(_do-not-handle_) do-not-handle] [#(_error_details) error] handle [#(_raise_err-name_&_args) raise] [#(_raise*_err) raise*] [#(_throw-msg_class-name) throw-msg] [#(_with-handler_&_forms) with-handler] 

----
===(_bind-continue_ continue-name [args`*`] & body)===
Special form to be used inside a 'with-handler'.
Control can be passed to this 'continue' form from a 'raise' enclosed
in this with-handler's dynamic scope, when this 'continue-name' is
given to a 'continue' form.
----
===(_deferror_ name [parent-error?] doc-string? [args`*`] & body)===
===(_deferror_ name [parent-error?] doc-string? args-destruct-map & body)===
====Macro====
Define a new error type
----
===(_do-not-handle_)===
====Macro====
Use in a tail position of a 'handle' form to indicate 'raise' should
not consider the error handled, but should continue searching for an
appropriate 'handle' form.  Allows finer-grain control over catching
than just the error type.
----
===(_error_ details)===
Base type for all error-kit errors
----
===(_handle_ error-name? [args`*`] & body)===
===(_handle_ error-name? args-destruct-map-args & body)===
Special form to be used inside a 'with-handler'.  When
any error is 'raised' from withing the dynamic scope of 'body' that
is of error-name's type or a derived type, the args will be bound
and the body executed.  If no 'error-name' is given, the body will
be executed for regardless of the type of error raised.  The body
may return a value, in which case that will be the return value of
the entire 'with-handler' form, or it may use any of the special
return forms, 'do-not-handle', 'continue-with', or 'continue'.
----
===(_raise_ err-name & args)===
====Macro====
Raise an error of the type err-name, constructed with the given args
----
===(_raise`*`_ err)===
Raise the given error object, best if created by an error
constructor defined with deferror.  See also 'raise' macro.
----
===(_throw-msg_ class-name)===
====Macro====
Returns a function that throws a Java Exception with the given
name.  Useful to associate a new error-kit error type with a
particular Java Exception class, via the :unhandled error key.
----
===(_with-handler_ & forms)===
====Macro====
This is error-kit's dynamic scope form.  The body will be executed
in a dynamic context that includes all of the following 'handle' and
'bind-continue' forms.
