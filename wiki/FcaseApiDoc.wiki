===case===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_case_ test-value & clauses)*
</pre>
<pre> Like cond, but test-value is compared against the value of each
 test expression with =.  If they are equal, executes the "body"
 expression.  Optional last expression is executed if none of the
 test expressions match.</pre>

===fcase===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_fcase_ compare-fn case-value & test-expr-clauses)*
</pre>
<pre> Generic switch/case macro.  'fcase' is short for 'function case'.
 
  The 'compare-fn' is a fn of two arguments.
 
  The 'test-expr-clauses' are value-expression pairs without
 surrounding parentheses, like in Clojure's 'cond'.
 
  The 'case-value' is evaluated once and cached.  Then, 'compare-fn'
 is called once for each clause, with the clause's test value as its
 first argument and 'case-value' as its second argument.  If
 'compare-fn' returns logical true, the clause's expression is
 evaluated and returned.  If 'compare-fn' returns false/nil, we go to
 the next test value.
 
  If 'test-expr-clauses' contains an odd number of items, the last
 item is the default expression evaluated if no case-value matches.
 If there is no default expression and no case-value matches, fcase
 returns nil.
 
  See specific forms of this macro in 'case' and 're-case'.
 
  The test expressions in 'fcase' are always evaluated linearly, in
 order.  For a large number of case expressions it may be more
 efficient to use a hash lookup.</pre>

----
===in-case===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_in-case_ test-value & clauses)*
</pre>
<pre> Like case, but test expressions are sequences.  The test expression
 is true if any item in the sequence is equal (tested with '=') to
 the test value.</pre>

----
===instance-case===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_instance-case_ test-value & clauses)*
</pre>
<pre> Like case, but the test expressions are Java class names, tested with
 'instance?'.</pre>

[http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/source/browse/trunk/src/clojure/contrib/fcase/clojure/contrib/fcase.clj#81 Source] [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=instance-case+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fclojure-contrib\.googlecode\.com&sbtn=Search Search for references in contrib]
----
===re-case===
====macro====
<pre>
Usage: *(_re-case_ test-value & clauses)*
</pre>
<pre> Like case, but the test expressions are regular expressions, tested
 with re-find.</pre>
