----
===(`_`deep-merge-with`_` f & maps)===
<pre> Like merge-with, but merges maps recursively, appling the given fn
only when there's a non-map at a particular level.

 (deepmerge + {:a {:b {:c 1 :d {:x 1 :y 2}} :e 3} :f 4}
             {:a {:b {:c 2 :d {:z 9} :z 3} :e 100}})
-> {:a {:b {:z 3, :c 3, :d {:z 9, :x 1, :y 2}}, :e 103}, :f 4}</pre>
----
===(`_`lazy-get`_` map key not-found)===
====Macro====
<pre> Like get, but doesn't evaluate not-found unless it is needed.</pre>
----
===(`_`safe-get`_` map key)===
<pre> Like get, but throws an exception if the key is not found.</pre>
----
===(`_`safe-get-in`_` map ks)===
<pre> Like get-in, but throws an exception if any key is not found.</pre>
