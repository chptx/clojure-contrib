----
===(_deep-merge-with_ f & maps)===
Like merge-with, but merges maps recursively, appling the given fn
only when there's a non-map at a particular level.

(deepmerge + {:a {:b {:c 1 :d {:x 1 :y 2}} :e 3} :f 4}
{:a {:b {:c 2 :d {:z 9} :z 3} :e 100}})
-> {:a {:b {:z 3, :c 3, :d {:z 9, :x 1, :y 2}}, :e 103}, :f 4}
----
===(_lazy-get_ map key not-found)===
====Macro====
Like get, but doesn't evaluate not-found unless it is needed.
----
===(_safe-get_ map key)===
Like get, but throws an exception if the key is not found.
----
===(_safe-get-in_ map ks)===
Like get-in, but throws an exception if any key is not found.
