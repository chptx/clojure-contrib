----
===_*local-javadocs*_===
Ref to a list of local paths for Javadoc-generated HTML
files.
----
===_*remote-javadocs*_===
Ref to a map from package name prefixes to URLs for remote
Javadocs.
----
===(_add-break-thread!_)===
===(_add-break-thread!_ t)===
Add the given thread to break-threads so that it will be stopped
any time the user presses Ctrl-C.  Calls start-handling-break for
you.  Adds the current thread if none is given.
----
===(_add-local-javadoc_ path)===
Adds to the list of local Javadoc paths.
----
===(_add-remote-javadoc_ package-prefix url)===
Adds to the list of remote Javadoc URLs.  package-prefix is the
beginning of the package name that has docs at this URL.
----
===_break-threads_===
Threads to stop when Ctrl-C is pressed.  See 'add-break-thread!'
----
===(_find-javadoc-url_ classname)===
Searches for a URL for the given class name.  Tries
*local-javadocs* first, then *remote-javadocs*.  Returns a string.
----
===(_get-source_ x)===
Returns a string of the source code for the given symbol, if it can
find it.  This requires that the symbol resolve to a Var defined in
a namespace for which the .clj is in the classpath.  Returns nil if
it can't find the source.  For most REPL usage, 'source' is more
convenient.

Example: (get-source 'filter)
----
===(_javadoc_ class-or-object)===
Opens a browser window displaying the javadoc for the argument.
Tries *local-javadocs* first, then *remote-javadocs*.
----
===(_show_ x)===
===(_show_ x selector)===
With one arg prints all static and instance members of x or (class x).
Each member is listed with a number which can be given as 'selector'
to return the member object -- the REPL will print more details for
that member.

The selector also may be a string or regex, in which case only
members whose names match 'selector' as a case-insensitive regex
will be printed.

Finally, the selector also may be a predicate, in which case only
members for which the predicate returns true will be printed.  The
predicate will be passed a single argument, a map that includes the
:text that will be printed and the :member object itself, as well as
all the properies of the member object as translated by 'bean'.

Examples: (show Integer)  (show [])  (show String 23)  (show String "case")
----
===(_source_ n)===
====Macro====
Prints the source code for the given symbol, if it can find it.
This requires that the symbol resolve to a Var defined in a
namespace for which the .clj is in the classpath.

Example: (source filter)
----
===(_start-handling-break_)===
Register INT signal handler.  After calling this, Ctrl-C will cause
all break-threads to be stopped.  See 'add-break-thread!'
