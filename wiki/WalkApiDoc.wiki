----
===(_keywordize-keys_ m)===
Recursively transforms all map keys from strings to keywords.
----
===(_macroexpand-all_ form)===
Recursively performs all possible macroexpansions in form.
----
===(_postwalk_ f form)===
Performs a depth-first, post-order traversal of form.  Calls f on
each sub-form, uses f's return value in place of the original.
Recognizes all Clojure data structures except sorted-map-by.
Consumes seqs as with doall.
----
===(_postwalk-demo_ form)===
Demonstrates the behavior of postwalk by printing each form as it is
walked.  Returns form.
----
===(_postwalk-replace_ smap form)===
Recursively transforms form by replacing keys in smap with their
values.  Like clojure/replace but works on any data structure.  Does
replacement at the leaves of the tree first.
----
===(_prewalk_ f form)===
Like postwalk, but does pre-order traversal.
----
===(_prewalk-demo_ form)===
Demonstrates the behavior of prewalk by printing each form as it is
walked.  Returns form.
----
===(_prewalk-replace_ smap form)===
Recursively transforms form by replacing keys in smap with their
values.  Like clojure/replace but works on any data structure.  Does
replacement at the root of the tree first.
----
===(_stringify-keys_ m)===
Recursively transforms all map keys from keywords to strings.
----
===(_walk_ inner outer form)===
Traverses form, an arbitrary data structure.  inner and outer are
functions.  Applies inner to each element of form, building up a
data structure of the same type, then applies outer to the result.
Recognizes all Clojure data structures except sorted-map-by.
Consumes seqs as with doall.
