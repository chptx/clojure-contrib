(ns <your-namespace>
  (:use clojure.contrib.with-ns))

==Public Variables and Functions==
----
===(_with-ns_ ns & body)===
====Macro====
Evaluates body in another namespace.  ns is either a namespace
object or a symbol.  This makes it possible to define functions in
namespaces other than the current one.
----
===(_with-temp-ns_ & body)===
====Macro====
Evaluates body in an anonymous namespace, which is then immediately
removed.  The temporary namespace will 'refer' clojure.core.
