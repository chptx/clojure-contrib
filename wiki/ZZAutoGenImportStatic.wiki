=API for clojure.contrib.import-static=
==Public Variables and Functions==
[[#import-static]]
----
===(_import-static_ class & fields-and-methods)===
====Macro====
Imports the named static fields and/or static methods of the class
  as (private) symbols in the current namespace.

  Example: 
      user=> (import-static java.lang.Math PI sqrt)
      nil
      user=> PI
      3.141592653589793
      user=> (sqrt 16)
      4.0

  Note: The class name must be fully qualified, even if it has already
  been imported.  Static methods are defined as MACROS, not
  first-class fns.
