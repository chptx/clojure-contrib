=API for clojure.contrib.probabilities.dist=
==Public Variables and Functions==
[[#certainly]]
----
===(_certainly_ v)===
Returns a distribution in which the single value v has probability 1.
[[#choose]]
----
===(_choose_ & choices)===
Construct a distribution from an explicit list of probabilities
   and values. They are given in the form of a vector of probability-value
   pairs. In the last pair, the probability can be given by the keyword
   :else, which stands for 1 minus the total of the other probabilities.
[[#cond-dist-m]]
----
===(_cond-dist-m_)===
Variant of the dist monad that can handle undefined values.
[[#cond-prob]]
----
===(_cond-prob_ pred dist)===
Returns the conditional probability for the values in dist that satisfy
   the predicate pred.
[[#dist-m]]
----
===(_dist-m_)===
Monad describing computations on fuzzy quantities, represented by a finite
   probability distribution for the possible values. A distribution is
   represented by a map from values to probabilities.
[[#join-with]]
----
===(_join-with_ f dist1 dist2)===
Returns the distribution of (f x y) with x from dist1 and y from dist2.
[[#normalize]]
----
===(_normalize_ weights)===
Convert a weight map (e.g. a map of counter values) to a distribution
   by multiplying with a normalization factor. If the map has a key
   :total, its value is assumed to be the sum over all the other values and
   it is used for normalization. Otherwise, the sum is calculated
   explicitly. The :total key is removed from the resulting distribution.
[[#normalize-cond]]
----
===(_normalize-cond_ cdist)===
[[#prob]]
----
===(_prob_ pred dist)===
Return the probability that the predicate pred is satisfied in the
   distribution dist, i.e. the sum of the probabilities of the values
   that satisfy pred.
[[#select]]
----
===(_select_ n xs)===
[[#uniform]]
----
===(_uniform_ coll)===
Return a distribution in which each of the elements of coll
   has the same probability.
