==Public Variables and Functions==
[[#*db*]]
----
===(_*db*_)===
[[#connection*]]
----
===(_connection*_)===
Returns the current database connection (or throws if there is none)
[[#find-connection*]]
----
===(_find-connection*_)===
Returns the current database connection (or nil if there is none)
[[#get-connection]]
----
===(_get-connection_ {:keys [datasource username password classname subprotocol subname], :as db-spec})===
Creates a connection to a database. db-spec is a map containing values
  for one of the following parameter sets:

  DataSource:
    :datasource  (required) a javax.sql.DataSource
    :username    (optional) a String
    :password    (optional) a String

  DriverManager:
    :classname   (required) a String, the jdbc driver class name
    :subprotocol (required) a String, the jdbc subprotocol
    :subname     (required) a String, the jdbc subname
    (others)     (optional) passed to the driver as properties.
[[#rollback]]
----
===(_rollback_)===
===(_rollback_ val)===
Accessor for the rollback flag on the current connection
[[#transaction*]]
----
===(_transaction*_ func)===
Evaluates func as a transaction on the open database connection. Any
  nested transactions are absorbed into the outermost transaction. By
  default, all database updates are committed together as a group after
  evaluating the outermost body, or rolled back on any uncaught
  exception. If rollback is set within scope of the outermost transaction,
  the entire transaction will be rolled back rather than committed when
  complete.
[[#with-connection*]]
----
===(_with-connection*_ db-spec func)===
Evaluates func in the context of a new connection to a database then
  closes the connection.
[[#with-query-results*]]
----
===(_with-query-results*_ [sql & params :as sql-params] func)===
Executes a query, then evaluates func passing in a seq of the results as
  an argument. The first argument is a vector containing the (optionally
  parameterized) sql query string followed by values for any parameters.
