=API for clojure.contrib.test-is=
==Public Variables and Functions==
----
===_*load-tests*_===
True by default.  If set to false, no test functions will
be created by deftest, set-test, or with-test.  Use this to omit
tests when compiling or loading production code.
----
===_*stack-trace-depth*_===
The maximum depth of stack traces to print when an Exception
is thrown during a test.  Defaults to nil, which means print the 
complete stack trace.
----
===(_are_ expr & args)===
====Macro====
Checks multiple assertions with a template expression.
See clojure.contrib.template/do-template for an explanation of
templates.
Example: (are (= _1 _2)  
2 (+ 1 1)
4 (* 2 2))
Expands to: 
(do (is (= 2 (+ 1 1)))
(is (= 4 (* 2 2))))
Note: This breaks some reporting features, such as line numbers.
----
===(_assert-any_ msg form)===
Returns generic assertion code for any test, including macros, Java
method calls, or isolated symbols.
----
===(_assert-predicate_ msg form)===
Returns generic assertion code for any functional predicate.  The
'expected' argument to 'report' will contains the original form, the
'actual' argument will contain the form with all its sub-forms
evaluated.  If the predicate returns false, the 'actual' form will
be wrapped in (not...).
----
===(_compose-fixtures_ f1 f2)===
Composes two fixture functions, creating a new fixture function
that combines their behavior.
----
===(_deftest_ name & body)===
====Macro====
Defines a test function with no arguments.  Test functions may call
other tests, so tests may be composed.  If you compose tests, you
should also define a function named test-ns-hook; run-tests will
call test-ns-hook instead of testing all vars.
Note: Actually, the test body goes in the :test metadata on the var,
and the real function (the value of the var) calls test-var on
itself.
When *load-tests* is false, deftest is ignored.
----
===(_deftest-_ name & body)===
====Macro====
Like deftest but creates a private var.
----
===(_file-position_ n)===
Returns a vector [filename line-number] for the nth call up the
stack.
----
===(_function?_ x)===
Returns true if argument is a function or a symbol that resolves to
a function (not a macro).
----
===(_get-possibly-unbound-var_ v)===
Like var-get but returns nil if the var is unbound.
----
===(_inc-report-counter_ name)===
Increments the named counter in *report-counters*, a ref to a map.
Does nothing if *report-counters* is nil.
----
===(_is_ form)===
===(_is_ form msg)===
====Macro====
Generic assertion macro.  'form' is any predicate test.
'msg' is an optional message to attach to the assertion.
Example: (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)) "Two plus two should be 4")
Special forms:
(is (thrown? c body)) checks that an instance of c is thrown from
body, fails if not; then returns the thing thrown.
(is (thrown-with-msg? c re body)) checks that an instance of c is
thrown AND that the message on the exception matches (with
re-matches) the regular expression re.
----
===(_join-fixtures_ fixtures)===
Composes a collection of fixtures, in order.  Always returns a valid
fixture function, even if the collection is empty.
----
===(_print-results_ r)===
Prints formatted results message based on the reported counts
returned by test-ns.
----
===_report_===
Handles the result of a single assertion.  'event' is one
of :pass, :fail, or :error.  'msg' is a comment string associated
with the assertion.  'expected' and 'actual' are quoted forms,
which will be rendered with pr-str.
Special case: if 'event' is :info, just the 'msg' will be
printed.
You can rebind this function during testing to plug in your own
test-reporting framework.
----
===(_run-all-tests_)===
Runs all tests in all namespaces; prints results.
----
===(_run-tests_)===
===(_run-tests_ & namespaces)===
Runs all tests in the given namespaces; prints results.
Defaults to current namespace if none given.
----
===(_set-test_ name & body)===
====Macro====
Experimental.
Sets :test metadata of the named var to a fn with the given body.
The var must already exist.  Does not modify the value of the var.
When *load-tests* is false, set-test is ignored.
----
===(_test-all-vars_ ns)===
Calls test-var on every var interned in the namespace, with fixtures.
----
===(_test-ns_ ns)===
If the namespace defines a function named test-ns-hook, calls that.
Otherwise, calls test-all-vars on the namespace.  'ns' is a
namespace object or a symbol.
Internally binds *report-counters* to a ref initialized to
*inital-report-counters*.  Returns the final, dereferenced state of
*report-counters*.
----
===(_test-var_ v)===
If v has a function in its :test metadata, calls that function,
with *testing-vars* bound to (conj *testing-vars* v).
----
===(_testing_ string & body)===
====Macro====
Adds a new string to the list of testing contexts.  May be nested,
but must occur inside a test function (deftest).
----
===(_testing-contexts-str_)===
Returns a string representation of the current test context. Joins
strings in *testing-contexts* with spaces.
----
===(_testing-vars-str_)===
Returns a string representation of the current test.  Renders names
in *testing-vars* as a list, then the source file and line of
current assertion.
----
===(_try-expr_ msg form)===
====Macro====
Used by the 'is' macro to catch unexpected exceptions.
You don't call this.
----
===(_with-test_ definition & body)===
====Macro====
Takes any definition form (that returns a Var) as the first argument.
Remaining body goes in the :test metadata function for that Var.
When *load-tests* is false, only evaluates the definition, ignoring
the tests.
